# Image Decoder Project #

• Engineered a full Verilog HDL-based digital system to decode images from a custom FPGA image encoder, involving complex timing control and hardware-level pipeline design.

• Completed this advanced upper‑year project completed by fewer than 15% of students, demonstrating strong initiative and above-expected technical capability.
